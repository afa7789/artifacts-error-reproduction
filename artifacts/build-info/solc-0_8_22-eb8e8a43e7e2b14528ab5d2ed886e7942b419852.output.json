Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"errors\":{\"InvalidInitialization()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is already initialized.\"}],\"NotInitializing()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is not initializing.\"}]},\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@5.4.0/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\"project/:@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/=npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@5.4.0/\",\"project/:@openzeppelin/contracts/=npm/@openzeppelin/contracts@5.4.0/\"]},\"sources\":{\"npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@5.4.0/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xdb4d24ee2c087c391d587cd17adfe5b3f9d93b3110b1388c2ab6c7c0ad1dcd05\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ab7b6d5b9e2b88176312967fe0f0e78f3d9a1422fa5e4b64e2440c35869b5d08\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXKYWWyzcLg1B2k7Sb1qkEXgLCYfXecR9wYW5obRzWP1Q\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@5.4.0/utils/ContextUpgradeable.sol":{"ContextUpgradeable":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"name":"InvalidInitialization","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"NotInitializing","type":"error"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint64","name":"version","type":"uint64"}],"name":"Initialized","type":"event"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.22+commit.4fc1097e\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"InvalidInitialization\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"NotInitializing\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":false,\"internalType\":\"uint64\",\"name\":\"version\",\"type\":\"uint64\"}],\"name\":\"Initialized\",\"type\":\"event\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data.

contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable through an associated {ProxyAdmin} instance. To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two things that go hand in hand: 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself. 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation. These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership. NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the implementation. NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract. IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin. Relying on the value of the admin slot is generally fine if the implementation is trusted. WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.\",\"errors\":{\"AddressEmptyCode(address)\":[{\"details\":\"There's no code at `target` (it is not a contract).\"}],\"ERC1967InvalidAdmin(address)\":[{\"details\":\"The `admin` of the proxy is invalid.\"}],\"ERC1967InvalidImplementation(address)\":[{\"details\":\"The `implementation` of the proxy is invalid.\"}],\"ERC1967NonPayable()\":[{\"details\":\"An upgrade function sees `msg.value > 0` that may be lost.\"}],\"FailedCall()\":[{\"details\":\"A call to an address target failed.

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

This pattern implies two\n things that go hand in hand:\n 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\n that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.\n 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to\n the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating\n the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.\n These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a\n dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to\n call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and\n allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative\n interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.\n NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\n inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\n mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\n fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\n implementation.\n NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a\n meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.\n IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an\n immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be\n overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an\n undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin. Relying on the value of the admin slot\n is generally fine if the implementation is trusted.\n WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the\n compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above.
